Setting up QT
=============

What you'll need
----------------

* A monitor
* A mouse and keyboard
* Wireless internet

QT has two ports: one USB-C and one USB-A.  You'll need to use the USB-C port for display and figure out how to control a mouse and keyboard.  I suggest a USB-C hub that has a display port that you can use (USB-C or HDMI, for example) and has USB-A ports for your mouse and keyboard.  Alternatively, you can use a USB-A hub to connect your mouse and keyboard to QT.

.. note::

    If you have trouble using your mouse or keyboard through a USB-C port, try flipping the USB-C input going into QT.  In theory, USB-C should go both ways, but in practice, sometimes not.
